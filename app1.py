JP Morganâ€™s Glasgow hub builds the technology that powers global finance.  
Iâ€™m drawn to environments where small, elegant pieces of code can have huge real-world impact.  
The apprenticeship model fits perfectly with how I learn best â€” through collaboration, feedback, and building things that matter.  
Iâ€™m eager to contribute to that culture while continuing to grow as a developer.
