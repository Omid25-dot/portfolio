    I’m an aspiring Python developer who’s been building up my skills through hands on projects and problem-solving.
I love finding smart, practical ways to use tech to make life easier whether that’s through automation or AI.
Right now, I’m working on a **Smart Fridge AI Assistant** that uses a Raspberry Pi Camera to recognise what’s inside a fridge and suggests meals based on the items that are in the fridge.
This page gives a quick, interactive look at some of the things I’ve worked on and why I think I’d be a great fit for JP Morgan.

st.write("""
J.P. Morgan’s tech teams work on systems that power global finance — that scale and responsibility really motivates me.
Developers here don’t just write code — they build tools that move billions, fight fraud, and make banking faster and safer.
I like how J.P. Morgan combines finance + innovation, using AI, cloud tech, and data to solve real problems.
The idea of learning from engineers who work on projects that actually impact the world is exciting to me.
It feels like the perfect place to grow as a developer while working on something meaningful and global.
